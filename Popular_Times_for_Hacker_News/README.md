# Popular Hours for Hacker News

This project looks into a growing social news website, "Hacker News", and analyzes popular time where users are the most active on the Ask HN section.

## Extracting Hacker News Posts 

We will first seperate posts by creating empty lists for "Ask HN" and "Show HN" and appending the post if the title starts with those words.

## Posts and Comments Created

For each Ask HN post, we categorized by the hour of when
* the posts were created
* comments were made

By doing so, we are able to find popular hours for Ask HN.
